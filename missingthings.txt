Missing things in fabric:
	1. Need to add cancel or back button on add/edit page of fabric. (This needs to be done on all other add/edit pages I check some pages like on button we alos missed this so need to check all the add/edit page to add canel button)
	2. Under the fabric form we have missed some fields
		a) Fabric Type: (Cotton, Linon, Egyptian Geza Cotton etc.).
		a) Fabric Pattern: (Stripes, Checks, Solid & Monotones and Print & Others).
		c) Fabric For: (Shir,Trouser,Blazer)
		So please all these fields in fabric add/edit form and also in database if not added in database.

	3. Under the button add/edit we need change the button name like "buttton_2" prifix need to be "button_" and then add the id of that button.
	4. Need to add the button section in front end where we are showing the fabric and editor div so also fetch the buttons as well as the fabric if possible then please add the tabs first for fabric and second for style (I will add the content in this tab) and third tab for buttons and fetch all the applicable buttons for this fabric.
